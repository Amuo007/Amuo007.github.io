title: "SiriMind iOS App"
excerpt: "
This is a native iOS application I developed using UIKit and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 API during the early days of ChatGPT. At the time, OpenAI had not yet released their official app, and I wanted a solution that allowed for hands-free, multitasking-friendly interaction with ChatGPT.<br/>

The app integrates Firebase Authentication and Firebase Database for secure user management and data storage. This enables users to log in, manage their profiles, and store conversational data for personal analysis. By analyzing stored data, users can uncover patterns in their interactions, enhancing their productivity and self-awareness.<br/>

The app supports both text-based and voice-enabled interactions, providing a seamless and efficient way to communicate with AI without being tied to typing. This project showcases my expertise in:<br/>
	•	UIKit for iOS Development<br/>
	•	OpenAI API Integration<br/>
	•	Firebase Authentication & Database<br/>
	•	Creating User-Friendly Interfaces<br/>
	•	Innovating Solutions for Daily Productivity<br/>

This app reflects my passion for solving real-world problems by building intuitive, cutting-edge tools.<br/><img src='https://amuo007.github.io//images/pot_2_1.png'><br/>
